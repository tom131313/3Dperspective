Java port of C++ code found in StackOverflow and similarly a Python version found in GitHub
No warranty!  My best guess at a port but I am not an expert in C++ OpenCV and have no good way to verify it.
For experimental, teaching purposes only.

github manisoftwartist/perspectiveproj

App-with-trackbar.java incudes the OpenCV trackbar example to change the rotation angles.
Rename the file to App.java (or change the class name) to use it.
